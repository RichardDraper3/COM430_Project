Class is held either Tuesday or Thursday for your freshman and sophmore years, once you become a Junior class will be both Tuesdays and Thursdays, 
when you are a senior you have class Friday mornings.
In class you will learn how to give briefs, land navigation, Army symbology, movement techniques, 
and many other various techiqual things to prepare you to be an office on the United States Army.
At Saint Leo due to the smaller class sizes the cadre are able to provide you with a more personal education and spend more time with you outside of the class time to enure your understanding.
