As an ROTC cadet at Saint Leo University you are given a few different options for scholarships.

First, if you are coming out of high school looking to go to college for free, you are in the right place. Not only will the Army pay for your tuition, 
but Saint Leo will give you a matching grant that will pay for your room and board.
Some cadets are awarded the full four year scholarship, while nearly all the other cadets are given a 3 year scholarship. 
Along with this scholarship is a $420 stipend every month from the army and $600 book allowance every semester, so you are being paid to come to Saint Leo!

Second, if you are in the guard or reserve you are eligible for an SMP scholarship which has all the same benefits while remaining in your unit. 

Third, Green to gold, if you are already active duty and would like to obtain your degree in person, remain active, 
with the promise of commissioning after college ROTC is the route for you.
These cadets also recieve the same benefits on top of their active duty pay.
