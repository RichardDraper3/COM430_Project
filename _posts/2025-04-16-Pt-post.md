At Charlie we PT three times a week. PT can range anywhere from company runs to dodgeball.
The objectivev for PT is not to make your life miserable, it is to prepare you for the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) and to make you fit to serve.
At Saint Leo we often do PT in groups to build commrodery and to help push one another.
