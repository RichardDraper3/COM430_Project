The Army ROTC program at Saint Leo University, in partnership with the University of South Florida (USF) Army ROTC, provides
students with the opportunity to develop leadership skills, tactical proficiency, and a commitment to service while pursuing a college
degree. Army ROTC is designed to prepare students for careers as commissioned officers in the U.S. Army, Army National Guard, or
Army Reserve. ROTC provides a scholarship for students in the program, that pays for full toution and housing!
We are Charlie Company! We are located on the campus of Saint Leo University, and work in junction with USF for big Batallion wide events.
Through USF Army ROTC, students engage in rigorous leadership training, military science coursework, and physical fitness
development. The program emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making in high-pressure situations, fostering
well-rounded leaders who are ready to take on the responsibilities of military service.
